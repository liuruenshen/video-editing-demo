00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:03,953
We've got a third party...

Wearing sunglasses,
just out the window.

00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:09,692
You're not
gonna kill me.

00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,630
Good-bye, crow.

You say something,
chief?

No.

We got time
on this one, jad.

13
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:45,161
You mind going down
and getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

I'm starving.
Sure, chief.

I think I'll get one
for myself
while I'm at it.

16
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,168
Take your time.
